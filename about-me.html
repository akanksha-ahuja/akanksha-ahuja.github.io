<h3>Hello World<h3>, 

<p>I am a Akanksha, a global citizen working on my way to make a difference in physics and computing.
Open to new experiences and challenges, I am optimistic and pasionate about scientific research.
For now, they are two branches in my life, yet to be merged with the master branch.</p>

<p>Seeking answers to the unknown everyday, that's how I debug and operate.</p> 
<p>If you'd like to see my work, dive in and reach out at akanksha.ahuja99@gmail.com</p>

<p>See you on the other side!</p>
